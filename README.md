Hi! My name is Seth Konynenbelt, a student at GVSU. I created this GitHub to help me work with partners on code, track changes, 
and have potential employers to view my code!

I am a computer engineering major interested in Embedded Engineering. I enjoy working with both hardware and software. I most enjoy
C, VHDL, Python, and MATLAB. I am staying busy working on a custom hardware platform and virtual machine operating system for the Kria SoM. 

Reach me @ sethkbelts@gmail.com or 616-953-9786
