Hi, I am Seth Konynenbelt, a student at GVSU. I created this GitHub to help me work with partners on code, track changes, 
but also for potential employers to view my code!

I am a computer engineerin major interested in Embedded Engineering. I enjoy working with both hardware and software. I know
C, Java, Python, and MATLAB. I love working on personal project using a variety of Arduinos. I am currently working on
finishing up a chess project with full AI for school and a motion sensor triggered LED light strip in my free time.

Reach me @ sethkbelts@gmail.com or 616-953-9786
